# Email_Detector
<h1> Spam_Email_Detector</h1>
<h2>A Machine Learning project built using Python and the Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes (MultinomialNB) which is subtype of naive bayes algorithm to classify emails as spam or not spam.</h2>

Designed a Machine Learning pipeline for efficient preprocessing and model training.
Trained and saved a model for real-time spam detection.
To convert text into an array of int CountVectorizer has been used and from that MultinomialNB has used to detect whether it is spam or not
